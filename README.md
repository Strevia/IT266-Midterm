Quake 4 Mario Mod

This is a mod for Quake 4 which changes several Quake 4 functions into functions from various Mario games, mainly in the first area of the game. These include:

Movement Abilities:
- Press and hold the run/walk button to run.
- Running fills your P meter. When this hits 500, you run much faster and can jump higher.
- Jump quickly after landing to do double and triple jumps, which go much higher than normal jumps.

Powerups:
- The quad damage powerup is now a starman powerup. While it is active the P meter is always full and touching any Mario-ified enemies kills them.

Attacks:
- The rocket launcher is now a fire flower, bouncing along the ground and getting stuck in walls.

Monsters:
- The grunt functions as a goomba. It moves around randomly, and jumping on it kills it.

Interactables:
- The medic in the first area functions as a chuckster. Talk to him and he will throw you very high in the air.
- The area in front of the locked door is a warp, as in Super Mario 64. If you stand in the right spot you can warp up to the upper section.
