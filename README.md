Quake 4 Mario Mod

This is a mod for Quake 4 which changes several Quake 4 functions into functions from various Mario games, mainly in the first area of the game. These include:

Movement Abilities:
- Press and hold the run/walk button to run.
- Running fills your P meter. When this hits 500, you run much faster and can jump higher.
- Jump quickly after landing to do double and triple jumps, which go much higher than normal jumps.
- Quickly after crouching, if you hold forward and press jump, you can do a long jump.
- Quickly after crouching, if you jump without pressing and movement keys, you can do a backflip (which goes higher than a double jump but lower than a triple jump).

Powerups:
- The quad damage powerup is now a starman powerup. While it is active the P meter is always full and touching any Mario-ified enemies kills them.
- The haste powerup is a wing cap. While it is active you can triple jump to fly.
- The regeneration powerup is now a mini mushroom. You can jump much higher but you only have one health. Note: While there is a timer it does not actually mean anything, and the mini mushroom lasts until you die.
- The guard powerup is now a spring mushroom. You constantly spring off the ground and can do an extra high jump by pressing the jump button.
- The invisibility powerup is now a P balloon. While it is active, you float upwards until it runs out of time/

Attacks:
- The rocket launcher is now a fire flower, bouncing along the ground and getting stuck in walls.
- The grenade launcher throws hammers, which explode immediately on touching the ground.

Monsters:
- The grunt functions as a goomba. It moves around randomly, and jumping on it kills it.
- The berserker functions as a koopa. Jumping on it flips it over. Kicking it while it's flipped over pushes it. Jumping on it while it's rolling makes it stop rolling. After it's been flipped for some time it will flip back over.
- The strogg hover functions as a boo. It will steadily travel towards the player unless the player is looking at it.

Interactables:
- The medic in the first area functions as a chuckster. Talk to him and he will throw you very high in the air.
- The area in front of the locked door is a warp, as in Super Mario 64. If you stand in the right spot you can warp up to the upper section.
